## **Experiment No : 02**

## **Experiment Name : Guess the Secret Number with LimitedAttempts
 Create a number guessing game where the program selects a random secret number
 between 1 and 50. The user has to guess the number, and they get unlimited attempts until
 they guess correctly. However, if they exceed 10 attempts, the game stops, and a message
 indicates that theyâ€™ve run out of attempts.
 Use a while loop to keep asking the user for guesses, and use break when:
 1.The user guesses correctly.
 2.The attempt limit (10 guesses) is reached**

----------

## **Theory :**
<div align="justify">

- **Declaring Integer Variables :** Declare integer variables to store integer values. This reserves memory locations for these integers.<br>
- **Taking Input :** Using the scanf function, the program can receive input values from the user. These values are stored in the previously declared integer variables.<br>
- **Performing the Mathmeatical Operation :** Basically making a guessing system.<br>
- **Displaying the Result :** The result of the addition can be displayed using the printf function.  <br>

</div>

## **Code :**
```
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Welcome to the guessing game\n");
    printf("You will have 10 attempts\n");
    printf("Select a random number between \"1-50\" :\t");
    int number,i=0,s=45;
    int comparison;
    while(i<10)
    {
        i++;
        scanf("%d",&number);
        if (number>s)
        {
            comparison =1;
        }
        else if (number<s)
        {
            comparison =2;
        }
        else if  (number=s)
        {
            comparison =3;
        }
       switch (comparison) //just wanted to practice switch. That's why I used it here.
       {
       case 1:
        printf("Try lower\n");
        break;
       case 2:
       printf("Try Higher\n");
       break;
       case 3:
       printf("\"You are goddamn right\"- Walter White AKA Heisenberg\n");
       return 0;
       default:
       printf("Try something between \'1-50\'");
        break;
       }
    if (i>=10)
        {
            printf("You have ran out of attempts");
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
